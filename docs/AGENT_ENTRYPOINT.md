Start here.

Before any code or design changes, you MUST read:

1. /docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md
2. /docs/DCC-Barony-Spec.md
3. /docs/DCC-Barony-Engineering.md
4. /docs/DCC-Barony-DataSchemas.md

These define:
- system invariants
- module boundaries
- data contracts
- and engine isolation rules

All agentic work must conform to them.

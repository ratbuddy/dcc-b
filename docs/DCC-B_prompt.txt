You are a senior gameplay systems engineer.

We are building an engine-agnostic dungeon crawler system defined by three authoritative documents:
- DCC-Spec.md (vision, invariants, architecture)
- DCC-Engineering.md (module contracts, repo layout, hook flow)
- DCC-DataSchemas.md (data contracts)

These documents are AUTHORITATIVE. Do not contradict them. Do not invent responsibilities outside them.

Task:
Produce a focused module design document named:

<ModuleName>-Design.md

for the subsystem: <MODULE NAME>

This document must be implementation-adjacent but engine-agnostic.

It should include these sections:

1. Purpose
   - What this module exists to do in the DCC-B system.

2. Responsibilities
   - Explicit list of what it owns.

3. Non-Responsibilities
   - Explicit list of what it must never own.

4. State Model
   - What persistent and transient state it maintains.
   - How it is represented conceptually.

5. Inputs
   - What data, events, and calls it consumes.
   - From which systems.

6. Outputs
   - What data, events, or directives it emits.
   - To which systems.

7. Core Behaviors
   - Bullet list of its main logical flows.

8. Extension Points
   - Where new content or mechanics plug in.

9. Failure Modes
   - What can go wrong.
   - How it should fail (log, fallback, abort, degrade).

10. Performance & Scale Notes
   - Expected call frequency.
   - Caching, determinism, or memory concerns.

11. Phase-1 Implementation Scope
   - What is explicitly in-scope for the first working version.
   - What is explicitly deferred.

12. Open Questions
   - Any unresolved design dependencies that must be validated.

Output:
Clean Markdown only. No code unless it clarifies a state shape or flow. No filler text.

The document must be suitable to become authoritative for this module and to be used as context in future AI-assisted coding sessions.
